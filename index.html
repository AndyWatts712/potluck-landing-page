    <p>This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?

We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.</p>
    <p>You need the dark in order to show the light. Imagination is the key to painting. Here we're limited by the time we have. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.

We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Here's something that's fun. Just beat the devil out of it. Let's have a little bit of fun today.
