        <p class="story-text-one">"If it weren't for Potlucky, our next gathering would have been a disaster! The site makes keeping track of everything simple, and let us focus on family. This year when we had to organize a celebratory potluck for our son's soccer championship victory we found the perfect place to help us get started and to see it through."</p>

        <p class="story-text-two">When we were trying to organize our first major potluck we weren't sure where to begin. Should we just try to make an event on facebook? Get in contact with people by phone? We had absolutely no idea. As luck would have it, one of us stumbled on Potlucky and it turned out to be a lot easier than we were afraid of. We were able to make a list of food items for guests to bring, let them pick what they wanted to bring item by item, and keep track of the ever growing guest list (with a few cancellations along the way, of course) with ease. By the time the day rolled around we were all ready to go and everything went off without a hitch. We didnâ€™t have to resort to the very user-unfriendly experience of facebook events or micromanage a hundred phone calls and clumsily designed lists in Microsoft Word. We were able to focus on family and friends and feel like a part of our community instead of feeling like overworked event coordinators.
