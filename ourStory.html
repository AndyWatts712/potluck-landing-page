        <p class="story-text-one">It is a lot of fun. Here's another little happy bush Let your imagination be your guide. And right there you got an almighty cloud. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start.</p>

      <div class="line-two">
        <p class="story-text-two">It's important to me that you're happy. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.

          Get tough with it, get strong. Just use the old one inch brush. If you hypnotize it, it will go away.
          
          You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. That easy. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.
          
          You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.
          
          There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Let's get crazy. Have fun with it. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Let's have a little bit of fun today. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.
          
          Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Here's something that's fun.
